          <p>
            As a former Realtor, I recognize that consistent marketing is the key to generating leads and closing sales. As a copywriter, I use my talent for communication to help Realtors®, builders, architects and other industry professionals build their businesses and get their story heard.

<!-- <h3>What's Your Story?</h3>
<p>Every story is compelling when it’s told the right way. I combine more than ten years of corporate experience with a talent for weaving a compelling narrative, and turn sales figures and statistics into success stories that capture the attention of your most desirable clients.</p>

<p>How can I help your business accomplish this? Let's talk one-on-one with a free, 30-minute story session.</p>

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>In the first twelve years of my professional life, I was an executive assistant with roles in the finance, real estate, and commercial food industries. In the four years before launching my freelancing career, I worked for the sales and marketing department of a large biotech firm. Take it from me: if you ever want to learn a lot about an industry, sitting behind an admin desk is a great place to start.</p>
<p>I went home at night to work on passion projects: blogs, personal essay, and novel-length literary fiction. I used narrative to bring worlds to life, and conversational writing to make blog readers laugh— and think.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to combine these two experiences into my ideal role: writing exciting and engaging content for clients in a variety of industries. It’s the perfect intersection of my skills, and I love using them to help clients get their stories heard.</p>

<h3>What Clients Say</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Belynda is an amazing blog writer. She not only writes compelling content that existing readers can relate to, but also understands the benefit properly implemented SEO practices can have in building your readership and following. Out of a large group of writers I work with, Belynda is always my first choice and no one else compares.

  <p>
    Over three years time Belynda helped my department grow their content collection immensely! From a blog entry to mutli-page white papers, no request was too big or small. Belynda was able to take our ideas and convey them in the professional, tech-savvy but, still light hearted tone that we were looking for. I would recommend her to anyone looking for ghost writing services.

  <p>
    Belynda was an essential part of our content team as her editing and writing skills became a necessary part of every aspect of our company's blog. Her ability to not only carefully craft a writer or brand's message was incredibly valuable, and her ways of tailoring a piece for a specific audience, no matter how niche it was, proved to be a crucial part of how Grow Socially communicated with prospects and clients.
