          <h3>A little about me</h3>
          <p>
            After several years providing proposal and technical writing for a major biometric software firm, I now pursue projects closer to my heart. I offer ghostwriting services for new works, as well as developmental editing services to take your existing manuscript from final draft to first run. I hold a Bachelor of Science in English from Northeastern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not refining narrative and cleaning up grammar, I am refining table manners and cleaning up toys for our eighteen-month-old triplets. In the golden hours after pajamas and bedtime stories, I love to write, knit, bake bread, and read classic and contemporary fiction.

            Have a first draft that needs help? Sent out query letters but havenâ€™t gotten any bites? I can address issues of structure, narrative, dialogue and pacing that could keep your story from coming to print.

            Do you have a well-groomed manuscript that just needs a fresh set of eyes? Allow me to read through your finished work for issues of grammar and continuity.
