          <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a freelance blogger and ghostwriter specializing in creating fabulous content for businesses in creative niches, such as crafting, food & beverage, entertainment, and speciality products. I also have expertise in parenting-related blogging and articles. I have over six years of experience creating quality content that engages and enlightens. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <Br>
            I write for specific industries for a simple reason: I love what do, and I want it to be fun! </p><Br>
            <p>
           
          </p>
          <p>
            When not refining keywords and cleaning up grammar, I am refining table manners and cleaning up toys for our two-year-old triplets. In the golden hours after pajamas and bedtime stories, I love to write, knit, bake bread, and read (sometimes two or more of these at once). I hold a Bachelor of Science in English from Northeastern University.
          </p>
       
          <p><h3>What Clients Say </h3></p>
         <p>Belynda is an amazing blog writer. She not only writes compelling content that existing readers can relate to, but also understands the benefit properly implemented SEO practices can have in building your readership and following. Out of a large group of writers I work with, Belynda is always my first choice and no one else compares."<br><br>

Over three years time Belynda helped my department grow their content collection immensely! From a blog entry to mutli-page white papers, no request was too big or small. Belynda was able to take our ideas and convey them in the professional, tech-savvy but, still light hearted tone that we were looking for. I would recommend her to anyone looking for ghost writing services.<br><br>

Belynda was an essential part of our content team as her editing and writing skills became a necessary part of every aspect of our company's blog. Her ability to not only carefully craft a writer or brand's message was incredibly valuable, and her ways of tailoring a piece for a specific audience, no matter how niche it was, proved to be a crucial part of how Grow Socially communicated with prospects and clients. <br><br>

                        There are times when a fresh perspective can breathe new life into your online content. If your post frequency has slowed due to a creative dry spell, I can brainstorm and develop new content, encourage sales of flagging products, and do the necessary research to position you as an authority in your industry.

             Has blogging slipped down your priorities list? Your blog is the heart of communication for your website, a place to showcase your knowledge to current and potential clients; however, well-crafted content takes time. Allow me to create compelling content and attract more traffic to your site, leaving you more time to grow your products and business.

          <h4>You Need More Visitors</h4>
          <p>
            Visitors buy products. They spread your message. Without a healthy and expanding readership, your website will not reach its full earning potential. Allow me to craft a comprehensive plan, from articles and keyword selection to distribution on social media. Increase your profits by increasing your reach.
