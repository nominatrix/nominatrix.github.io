          <p>
            In the first twelve years of my professional life, I was an executive assistant with roles in finance, real estate, dairy, and biotech firms. Take it from me: if you ever want to learn a lot about an industry, a great place to start is behind an admin desk.

            At night I went home and worked on passion projects: blogs, stories, and novel-length literary fiction. I used narrative to bring stories to life, and conversational writing to make blog readers laugh, and think.

            A few years ago, I had the opportunity to combine these two experiences into my ideal role: writing exciting and engaging content for clients in a variety of industries. It’s the perfect intersection of my skills, and I love using them to help clients get their stories heard.

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>In the first twelve years of my professional life, I was an executive assistant with roles in the finance, real estate, and commercial food industries. In the four years before launching my freelancing career, I worked for the sales and marketing department of a large biotech firm. Take it from me: if you ever want to learn a lot about an industry, sitting behind an admin desk is a great place to start.</p>
<p>I went home at night to work on passion projects: blogs, personal essay, and novel-length literary fiction. I used narrative to bring worlds to life, and conversational writing to make blog readers laugh— and think.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to combine these two experiences into my ideal role: writing exciting and engaging content for clients in a variety of industries. It’s the perfect intersection of my skills, and I love using them to help clients get their stories heard.</p>

<h3>What Clients Say</h3>

    Belynda is an amazing blog writer.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Over three years time Belynda helped my department grow their content collection immensely! From a blog entry to mutli-page white papers, no request was too big or small. Belynda was able to take our ideas and convey them in the professional, tech-savvy but, still light hearted tone that we were looking for. I would recommend her to anyone looking for ghost writing services.
