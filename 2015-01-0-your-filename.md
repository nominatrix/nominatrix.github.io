Once upon a time in an MLS far, far away, I was a residential Realtor. I loved the job, worked with a lot of great people and learned a lot about running a business. One aspect I wasn't prepared for was the amount of time devoted to marketing. I spent many a night in the office after hours, stuffing and stamping direct mail pieces as the tri-fold machine whirred furiously beside me. 

Much like your clients, I bet you have a need, want, would be nice list for your 2015 marketing efforts. I can help with:

Property Descriptions – Tell the story of the home behind the listing photo. With quick turnaround, a flawless and fabulous description can be on MLS within 48 hours. 

Blogging – I think of blogging as the laundry of your marketing plan. Sure, consistent effort keeps the system running smoothly--but with so much to do, the time between posts can pile up. Enjoy consistent, timely articles to keep your sphere informed and your site traffic growing.

Social Media – Coordinating your message across social media platforms reaches more buyers and sellers. Your prospective clients are on social media. Make sure they see you there, too.
 
Agent Biography – You’ve had a very successful 2014. Now is the best time to ensure your professional bio reflects the highlights of your career over the past 12 months.
 
Custom Marketing Collateral – Tailor-made newsletters, sales trend assessments, and community profiles. These concise, informative pieces add value to market analysis packages, listing packets, direct mail campaigns, and online resources.
