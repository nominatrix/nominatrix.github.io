Once upon a time in an MLS far, far away, I was a residential Realtor. I loved the job, worked with a lot of great people and learned a lot about running a business. One aspect I wasn't prepared for was the amount of time devoted to marketing. I spent many a night in the office after hours, stuffing and stamping direct mail pieces as the tri-fold machine whirred along furiously beside me. 

Real estate sales has evolved since I was an agent, but one thing that hasn't changed is the amount of marketing involved in keeping a steady pipeline. Property descriptions, direct mail pieces, marketing packages and bios all take time to generate. Add to that the real need for a personal site and a consistent blog, and it makes for a lot of time behind the desk. Many Realtors would rather spend their hours where the money is-- in the car with a client or at the closing table. Here's where a real estate copywriter comes in. 


Like  clients, Realtors have a "need, want, would be nice" list for their marketing. There are quite a few items a real estate copywriter can develop

Property Descriptions – Is there anything more time consuming than trying to come up with yet another synonym that the dreaded "cozy." A writer can develop a fresh description for your new listing with just a quick phone call and a look at the listing pictures. 

Blogging – Blogging is the laundry of your marketing plan. Sure, consistent effort keeps the system running smoothly--but with so much to do, the time between posts can pile up. A writer can keep the ideas and the posts coming, and keep your site traffic climbing.

Social Media – Yes, Realtors, you really _do_ want to be on Twitter. Your clients are online, and you should be, too. Plug and play social media updates are a great resource for your online marketing.
 
Agent Biography – Does your bio include your most recent successes and milestones? Writing about yourself can be a bit awkward. A real estate copywriter can take your achievements and turn them into a great sales tool with just a quick interview. 
 
Custom Marketing Collateral – Custom made pieces in marketing packages, mail campaigns, and online showcase you as an authority in your market. They're a great way to add value to your marketing efforts without spending hours trying to dream up a topic and do the research.
