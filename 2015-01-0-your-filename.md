Once upon a time in an MLS far, far away, I was a residential Realtor. I loved the job, worked with a lot of great people. I learned plenty about running a business-- skills that serve me to this day. One aspect I wasn't prepared for at the outsite was the amount of time I'd devote to marketing. Many a night was spent in the office after hours, stuffing and stamping direct mail pieces as the tri-fold machine whirred along furiously beside me. I wrote all my own material, as most Realtors do, and it can definitely eat up a chunk of time.

Real estate sales has evolved since I was an agent, but the amount of marketing involved in keeping a steady pipeline has only increased. Property descriptions, direct mail pieces, marketing packages, and bios all take time to generate. Add to that the real need for a personal site and a consistent blog, and that makes for a lot of hours slinging adjectives behind the desk. Many Realtors would rather spend their hours where the money is-- in the car with a client or at the closing table. This is where your real estate copywriter comes in. 

Like  clients, Realtors have a "need, want, would be nice" list for their marketing. There are quite a few items a real estate copywriter can develop, and much of the content can be used across multiple media outlets.

**Property Descriptions – **Is there anything more time consuming than trying to come up with yet another synonym for the dreaded "cozy"? A writer can develop a fresh description for your new listing with just a quick phone call and a look at the listing pictures. 

**Blogging – **Blogging is the laundry pile of a marketing plan. Sure, consistent effort keeps the system running smoothly--but with so much to do, the time between posts can pile up. A writer can keep the ideas and the posts coming, and keep your site traffic climbing without you having to put a lot of time or thought into it. 

**Social Media –** Yes, Realtors, you really _do_ need to be on social media. Your clients are online, and you should be, too! Plug and play social media updates are a great resource for your online marketing.
 
**Agent Biography – **Does your bio include your most recent successes and milestones? Writing about yourself can be a bit awkward. A real estate copywriter can take your achievements and turn them into a great sales tool with just a short phone interview.
 
**Custom Marketing Collateral – **Custom pieces in marketing packages, mail campaigns, and on websites showcase you as an authority in your market. They're a great way to add value to your marketing efforts without spending hours trying to dream up a topic and do the research. 


If this is the year you vow to break free of your desk, engaging a real estate writer to take marketing content off your plate is one great way to achieve the goal. 

Happy 2015!
