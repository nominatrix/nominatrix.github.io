#Freelance Blogging Services: The True Cost Of A “$5 Blogger”

The content industry has (for quite a while now) been going through a bit of a market adjustment, where the availability of an inexpensive writing force has driven down the perceived value for business writing services. Writers are seemingly a dime a dozen, and in turn, articles and marketing pieces become a dime a dozen. They <em>can</em> be, as has been amply demonstrated. They shouldn’t be. 

But you might say: Why should you pay $50 or $100 per post, when you can get someone to write you twenty pieces for that amount? 

I run up against this sentiment all the time; it wasn’t until I started editing articles and content written by a “five dollar blogger” that I could full explain the monetary value in hiring a trusted, native speaking professional who is knowledgeable in your niche. The lifecycle of a cheap blog article goes something like this:

##Finding A Writer

You decide it’s time for freelance blogging services for your blog. You know you’re not doing the work: you don’t have time, or ideas. So you start looking for a blogger. A craigslist ad finds you approximately 100 candidates. “Holy moly,” you say. “How do I wade through all these applicants?” So you weed out the ones who are obviously not savvy on your subject, have really bad grammar in their pitches, or commit some awful pitch sin (they call you by the wrong name, wrong company, don’t add a portfolio or a resume.) Okay, now you whittle it down, slowly but surely, to maybe five candidates. You’ve just spent an hour on this process— if not more. 

You email the writers, ask for their rates. Three of them quote you $50-100 per hour or per piece. Sure, they’re offering to do keyword analysis for you, pitch ideas, etc. But can’t you do that part? It’s the writing that takes all the time.

BUT! They’re professionals. They seem to get your product. 

Another writer quotes you $10 a piece. They’re not offering any of the extras, but like you said—you can do that. They’re in the running. 

Then we come to the “five dollar blogger.” A penny per word. “Wow! Okay! That’s reasonable!” You probably believe, for this price, you can get a lot more content-- and that means better rankings. Something in you thinks this might be too good to be true (it is), but you charge ahead and place an order with them. 

## The Results 

What you get back later that week is one of the following:

1. A grammatical horrorshow – Not spell-checked, strange syntax, just plain not great. 

2. Nonsense – The content doesn’t make sense on any level. “You are guaranteed to have make great smiling when you see our majestic baby food.” 

3. Keyword stuffing – They pick a keyword, but misspell it, then use it fifteen times. Google does not smile on this at all.

4.Nothing. They totally blow you off. At least you haven’t paid them for it. 

##Now What? 

Assuming they came through on the deadline, you have twenty articles that are total nonsense, or just not great. You’ve just spent an hour or more reading them, and you’re completely frustrated. What do you do? 

1. Edit them yourself. This should only take from now until next week.
2. Kick them back to the writer to be fixed—or more likely, be made what I call “different wrong.” 
3. Pay for them and have someone else edit them. Dole out $25 an hour for this person to read, re-write, optimize, and fix the articles. 

Let’s say your time is worth $50 an hour at a bare minimum. Time is an asset, so you have to count the hours spent on this process; they could have been devoted to other marketing efforts.

Your $5 blog articles, (based on twenty articles) just cost you $200-$400. 

* $100 for the two hours finding a writer and reading their work.
* $100 for payment to your five-dollar blogger.
* $100 for another editor to fix the work, or your time spent fixing them.
* $100 for TWO MORE HOURS finding and vetting a decent writer.

Ouch. 

##A Better Way

Freelance blogging services are a professional engagement. Hiring a writer is just like hiring a builder, a lawyer, or a dentist. You wouldn’t think twice about paying another professional $50-$100 per hour or per service. In many cases, you’d consider it a bargain. 

That same $400 you just spent in time and cash would get you:

* Four to five professionally written, researched, and edited posts by a blogger who specializes in your industry or niche. 
* Appropriate keywords that are correctly optimized, with great, Google-friendly titles to hook readers. 
* A pitch of fresh ideas for next month and take a few minutes to discuss your business so they can promo special events you have coming up. 
* Promotion-ready, plug-and-play status updates to promo new content on your social media feeds.

Still want that five-dollar blogger? If not, it’s time for a better blog marketing plan.
