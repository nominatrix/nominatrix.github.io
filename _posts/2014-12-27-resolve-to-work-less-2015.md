##Are You Resolving To Work Less In 2015?
<br>


I'm pretty fond of a few perennial New Year’s resolutions. Lose some pounds. Sleep more. Get back to running. Since having kids, resolving to go on more dates is a pretty popular notion in our house. We are very fortunate to have awesome family members that give us time off.

Speaking of time off… many people resolve to “work less” in the upcoming year, or conversely, “play more” with trips and leisure activities. While that's a [popular idea](http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/New-Years-Resolutions.shtml) and a worthy resolution, this nebulous goal never addresses the heart of the issue: most of us have too much on our plate! **It's impossible to work less without finding better ways to get things done.** One way is to find trustworthy professionals to take care of the time-draining items on your list— like writing! 

You might say, “I don’t have enough writing work to hire a freelancer,” But consider the time investment over a month: Even if you only spend an average of 15 minutes a day on writing-related activities (this could be anything from proofreading documents, to composing letters, writing copy, marketing, or creating proposals) you're still spending **five hours a month** on those tasks. That's more than half a workday! If you're in a sales-focused industry, you could be spending far more time than that. Suddenly that small chore doesn't seem so small, right? Now, let's consider the benefits of outsourcing the work.

We know that quality writing yields results far outstripping the cost of the work. If you’re dubious on the ROI potential of marketing efforts, check out this yummy list of stats put together by [SmartBug Media](http://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/26-stats-that-prove-content-marketing-increases-lead-generation-sales-and-roi) or this [data on ROI from RIT](http://printinthemix.com/Fastfacts/Show/414). 

You can do it yourself— but that takes time and research, and you’re trying to work less, not add stress. Using a competent freelance writer, you will spend $50-100 on a quality, Google-friendly blog article. This $50-100 investment has the potential to pull in thousands in new revenue month over month by attracting new customers and establishing trust with those who have yet to pull the trigger on a purchase. So you can hire a writer, get that time back in your schedule, and enjoy the results for fairly minimal cost. 

What you do with that time is your own. You can reinvest it in the business… or, be one of the diligent few who stick with their New Year’s resolution to WORK LESS. Sounds nice, doesn’t it?

This will probably be my last post for the year before the ball drops, so I’ll wish you all a happy, prosperous 2015! 

**What is your biggest time suck these days? AND, the bonus question: If you stick to your resolution of working less this year, what are you going to do for fun in 2015?**
