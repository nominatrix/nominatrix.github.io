Maintaining a blog is like any other healthy routine: easy to do for a week, harder to keep up on a regular basis. While slacking on the floss can land you in the dentist chair, slacking on your blog efforts can land you somewhere equally concerning: page seven of Google search results. It’s a place to which few people travel, and if they’re not making the trip, they will never become potential customers and clients.
To maintain the health of your online marketing efforts, blogging regularly is a must. If you’re hitting a slump, it could be time to outsource your blog writing.

## No Time

For small and medium business owners, blogging may start of strong. You are enthusiastic for the work, have plenty of ideas, and you’re hungry to get the business rolling. Once all that work pays off, though? Blogging starts to slip further down the priority list. Twice a week becomes once a week. Then the posts dwindle to once a month. Soon, the first thing your visitors see in June is your last post—wishing them a Happy Thanksgiving. If you go two, three, or more months without fresh material to drive traffic, it may be time to consider a freelance blogger.

## No Ideas

One of the pitfalls of “young” blogs is that they often begin in a rush of inspiration. You have plenty of ideas and a lot to say. As time wears on, and you use up your “aces in the hole,” coming up with new ideas becomes more of a task. Once writer’s block has a hold on you, the blog posts slow down, become sporadic, or (worst case scenario) stop all together. After a while, even ideas that could become great material get shelved as the pressure to get back on track mounts. You start to avoid the dreaded chore of posting new material. The remedy for this could be a fresh perspective. If you find it difficult to develop new material, a freelance blogger can help see your site and product from new angles.

## No Audience

Probably the most damaging of the three is the sense that, even if you post, no one is going to read it. The previous two issues are big contributors to this problem. Once your time and ideas dry up, you stop writing— and stop generating traffic to your blog. The result is, anything you do post gets less attention than it deserves. Nothing can defeat your efforts like the feeling of playing to an empty room. A freelance blogger can remedy this issue by developing a keyword strategy, creating a cohesive distribution strategy on social media, and improving the success of those efforts over time.

In order to maintain a healthy blog presence, you have to view the work of blogging as a lifestyle change for your business. If you find yourself facing time or creative constraints, finding a competent professional will free up your time, and help create a blog strategy to keep your traffic flowing and your pipeline full.
