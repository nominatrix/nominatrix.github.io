Once upon a time in an MLS far, far away, I was a residential Realtor. I loved the job, worked with a lot of great people. I learned _plenty_ about running a business-- skills that serve me to this day. One aspect I wasn't prepared for at the outset was the amount of time needed for marketing. Many a night was spent in the office after hours, stuffing and stamping direct mail pieces as the tri-fold machine whirred along furiously beside me. I wrote all my own material, as most Realtors do, so I know it can eat up a chunk of time.

Real estate marketing has evolved a bit since I was an agent, and the amount of time involved in keeping a steady pipeline has only increased. Property descriptions, direct mail pieces, marketing packages, and bios all take time to generate. Add to that the real need for a personal site and a consistent blog, and that makes for a lot of hours slinging adjectives behind the desk. Many Realtors would rather spend their working hours where the money is-- in the car with a client or at the closing table. This is where a great real estate copywriter comes in. 

Like  clients, most Realtors have a "need, want, would be nice" list for their marketing. They have great ideas for promo pieces, but many go unfulfilled because of the time crunch. There are quite a few items a real estate copywriter can develop, and much of the content can be used across multiple media outlets making it a valuable way to spend your marketing dollars.

**Property Descriptions – **Is there anything more frustrating than writing your way around a less-than-perfect property? A writer can develop a fresh pitch for your new listing with just a quick phone call and a gander at the listing pictures. They can also smooth over the rough edges with some winning copy. Never fear the dreaded "cozy" again.

**Blogging – **Blogging is the laundry pile of a marketing plan. Sure, consistent effort keeps the system running smoothly--but with so much to do, the time between posts can pile up. You get a great idea, post it, and six weeks later another bolt of inspiration has yet to arrive. A writer can keep the ideas and the posts coming, and keep your site traffic climbing without you having to put a lot of time or thought into it. 

**Social Media –** Yes, Realtors, you really _do_ need to be on social media. Your clients are online, and you should be, too! Plug and play social media updates are a great resource for your online marketing.
 
**Agent Biography – **Does your bio include your most recent successes and milestones? Writing about yourself can be a _bit_ awkward. A real estate copywriter can take your achievements and turn them into a great sales tool with just a short phone interview.
 
**Custom Marketing Collateral – **Custom pieces in marketing packages, mail campaigns, and on websites showcase you as the authority in your market. They're a great way to add value to your marketing efforts. Using a writer means saving those hours of research and writing. 


If this is the year you vow to break free of your desk, engaging a real estate writer to take marketing content off your plate is one great way to achieve the goal. I am currently building my writing schedule for 2015. If you'd like to learn more, [let's chat](mailto:belynda@belyndacianci.com).

Happy 2015!
