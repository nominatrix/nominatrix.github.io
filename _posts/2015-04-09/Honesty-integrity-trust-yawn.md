##Honesty, Integrity, and Trust? :::Yawn::: Give People The Goods On You

Pretty much every real estate professional wants to you know that they’re an honest, decent person who won’t take advantage of you or torpedo your deal. Great. But you can’t just assure people you’re all about honesty integrity, and trust. 

Remember the last guy who assured us, “I’m not a crook?” 

Precisely.  

So how do you show and not tell? Here’s three great ways to build trust online.

**1. Rock Your Niche.** When we watch shows about doctors, do we want to see a show about a primary care guy swabbing tonsils (zzzz), or a steely-nerved surgeon calmly stitching a heart back together against all medical odds? 

Generalists are fine, but specialists reach the audience most interested in special talent. Bring out your niche online with curated and original content that speaks to your specialty. Are you a short-sale guru? Luxury property maven? A new construction evangelist? Let people know exactly what are about, and the right ones will find you.

Don’t have a niche? Time to get at it. 

**2. Don’t Publish Low-Hanging Fruit.** Plenty of sites feature those tedious “Five Great Tips” posts. Don’t be like that. Fluff posts are usually [written for short money](http://belyndacianci.com/2014/11/28/five-dollar-blogger/), and that means written in short time. You know how the law of “Good, Fast, Cheap” pans out in such cases.

Your readers don’t care about five awesome ways to use your Magic Eraser. They care about how the reserve is going to affect your interest rate, how the [surge in buyer confidence](http://www.zillow.com/blog/5-million-renters-plan-to-buy-171611/)is going to affect their chances of getting the house of their dreams. Feed them the information you bump into every day, either as an informative blog, a curated share, or a quick tip on Twitter. The more they read you, the more they trust you. 

**3. Make Your Listing Posts Organic To The Conversation.** Yes, I know you want to post your listings. And you should. The problem with social media is: People don’t care about listings that aren’t in their area. You know what they LOVE, though?

Give the people what they want. Instead of JUST sticking up a link to your MLS page, snap a shot of a nice aspect of the house. Is their dining room staging pitch perfect? Maybe they have the PERFECT butler’s pantry or mudroom. Make it an example on Instagram, Pinterest and Houzz. Get people interested in the details. Locals will start to pay attention to your listings, and the rest of your audience will start to follow you for the eye candy and great advice. 

 Have fun out there!
