<p>I’m going to get my fork ready to eat some humble pie, because I recently made one of the worst mistakes concerning a domain name: I let it expire. Nothing makes things feel like amateur hour like realizing your site is offline. “That’s okay,” I said. “I’ll just renew it, get things back up and running, and be on my way.”<br><br>


Except, it’s just not that easy. <br><br>


This had never happened before, so I wasn’t aware expired registrations don’t just hang out waiting for you to wise up and restart your yearly fee. They go into what the industry calls a “redemption period,” and the rest of the civilized world calls “a hostage situation.” There is a brisk business in picking up expired domains at auction to repurpose or sell (sometimes back to their previous owners). <br><br>


As the previous owner, you have what amounts to a right of first refusal on your previously held domain within a certain window. For the low, low price of anywhere from $80-$250, you can renew your domain name during the redemption period and get back in business.<br><br>


Does that sound a little ridiculous? Yes? Okay, it’s not just me then. <br><br>


Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can really do about this situation with expired domains (until someone successfully sues to end the practice). You have two choices: Pay up, or...<br><br></p>

##Wait It Out


<p>Waiting it out takes an average of 95 days, during which you’ll be unable to do anything with the domain. If you have a lot of marketing material with that domain on it, the waiting period can become a huge problem. <br><br>


As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The best way to avoid this really unfortunate situation is to make sure your domains don’t expire. <br><br></p>


##Here’s what I learned


1. Make sure your registrar has your current information. In my particular case, we had recently moved, so our email address and primary billing address were different. The registrar had no way to alert us to the expiry.<br><br>


2. Set your domain renewal to auto-renew: If you don’t have to think about it, you don’t have to worry about it. Be sure your credit card information is up to date, so that there is no interruption in payment. <br><br>


3. Set a reminder: Tell Siri to ping you, put it in your Google calendar, or write it on your whiteboard. Whatever you have to do. Be your own failsafe. <br><br>


Take these precautions, and you’ll avoid ponying up ransom money for expired domain names.
